# DSB6200 Supply Chain Network
## Executive Summary for XRetailer's Supply Chain Network Design

### Introduction
XRetailer, a major US retailer, is engaged in both online and physical store sales across a variety of products. To enhance their operational efficiency and customer service, the company is focusing on optimizing the design of their supply chain network. This project aims to analyze and propose the optimal number and locations of Distribution Centers (DCs) to meet customer demands effectively.

### Objective
The primary objective is to assist XRetailer in determining the optimal number and location of their Distribution Centers to efficiently satisfy the demand of each customer for each SKU.

### Current Configuration
- **Current DCs**: 7 (NY, HS, LA, OG, SL, OL, DT)
- **Customers served**: 181 across the US
- Each DC is tasked with meeting the demands of the nearest customers, featuring distinct capacities and varied fixed, variable, and transportation costs.

### Analysis Phases

#### Phase 1: Data Understanding and Cost Calculation
- Analyze and compute various costs associated with each distribution center using specific formulas.

#### Phase 2: Baseline Model Analysis
- Examine the current supply chain model (as-is).
- Calculate total network costs and throughput for each facility.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of the current configuration.

#### Phase 3: Scenario Analysis and Recommendations
- Offer two what-if scenarios to explore alternative supply chain configurations.
- Provide additional calculations and recommend solutions to improve the supply chain design.

### Scope and Limitations
- **Scope**: Identify the optimal configuration for 6 DCs.
- **Limitations**: Analysis is confined to the outbound logistics from DCs to customers.

### Conclusion
The project will deliver multiple potential solutions to help XRetailer achieve an optimized supply chain network that supports long-term strategic objectives by minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency and customer satisfaction.
